# Grimoire

**Offensive knowledge, offline. One search box for every playbook.**

> by [Penthertz](https://penthertz.com) - part of the RF-Swift toolkit

Grimoire clones a curated set of security knowledge bases, indexes all of their
markdown/YAML into a single full-text search index, and serves a fast web UI.
Type `ssrf`, `xss`, `sql`, `kerberoast`, `sudo`, `jwt`, ... and it instantly
surfaces the matching pages across *every* source - HackTricks,
PayloadsAllTheThings, the OWASP guides, the living-off-the-land databases, and
your own notes - with a link back to each original.

Built to run anywhere (single Python script, no mandatory services) and to be
embedded in RF-Swift.

## Features

- **Unified search** over 20+ sources via SQLite **FTS5** with BM25 ranking -
  one query language regardless of how each repo is authored (mdBook, mkdocs,
  Jekyll, Hugo, plain markdown, YAML).
- **Fully offline** once fetched. No telemetry, no external calls at runtime.
- **Spawnable web service** - `grimoire.py serve` (bind host/port; run it in the
  background or as a container service).
- **Provenance** - every doc shows its source and a link to the **original file
  on GitHub**, so you always know where guidance came from.
- **Rich rendering** - images display and relative `.md` links navigate inside
  the viewer (relative `<img>`/links are rewritten to a guarded `/asset` / `/doc`
  endpoint). Note: for sparse sources (e.g. Ghidra), images stored outside the
  checked-out paths won't be present - widen the source's `sparse:` list if needed.
- **Copy-ready** - one-click copy buttons on every code/command block.
- **OSINT note** - OSINT tools mostly target individuals; scope and document
  collection to what an engagement justifies (GDPR), especially for named people.
- **Obsidian-friendly** - point it at your vault; `[[wikilinks]]`, `#tags` and
  YAML frontmatter are handled (links/tags become one-click searches).
- **Bring your own docs** - drop markdown in `custom/` or register a local path.
- **Optional native builds** - render a source's own mdBook/mkdocs site when the
  toolchain is present; search never depends on it.
- **Attach an AI model (MCP)** - `grimoire.py mcp` exposes the index over the
  Model Context Protocol, so Claude / Codex / Gemini / any MCP client can search,
  read docs, build source-backed technical checklists, assemble a topic's reads
  into a complete cited tutorial, and review whether the docs are current / find
  better techniques. It also adapts to your **engagement context** (targets,
  interfaces, hardware/SDRs, SIM, RF) so suggestions fit your assessment.
  Default `read` mode is read-only (no shell, no writes); opt into `--mode
  assist|auto` to let it detect/install missing tools (RF-Swift recipe, else the
  host package manager) and run steps, behind a destructive-command denylist and
  a target scope. See [docs/MCP_TUTORIAL.md](docs/MCP_TUTORIAL.md).

## Install & run

Install as a CLI with pipx (recommended) or pip - this puts `grimoire` on your PATH:

```bash
pipx install .           # (from a checkout)

grimoire all                          # clone every source + build the index
grimoire serve                        # http://127.0.0.1:8000
grimoire mcp                          # attach an AI model over MCP
```

When installed, user state (the editable `sources.yaml`, `custom/`, and the
`data/` index) lives in `$GRIMOIRE_HOME` (default `~/.local/share/grimoire`);
the manifest is seeded from a packaged default on first run.

Or run straight from a checkout (no install):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt    # PyYAML + markdown (both optional-degrading)
./grimoire.py all                  # clone every source + build the index
./grimoire.py serve                # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for the day-to-day commands and search tips.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fetch [--only N...]` | git clone/pull sources into `data/sources/` |
| `build` | optional native mdBook/mkdocs render into `data/build/` |
| `index [--force]` | incremental FTS5 index at `data/index.db` (only re-indexes sources whose git commit / content changed; `--force` = full rebuild) |
| `serve [--host H --port P]` | start the web search UI |
| `all [--only N...]` | `fetch` + `index` |
| `update [--only N...]` | refresh docs: `fetch` + `index` (alias of `all`) |
| `mcp` | expose Grimoire over MCP (stdio) so an AI model can attach |

Docs can also be refreshed live from the web UI with the **Update docs** button
(runs a background `fetch` + reindex and streams progress).

## Code layout (MVC)

The entrypoint `grimoire.py` is a thin launcher; the implementation lives in the
`grimoire_app/` package, split cleanly:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | filesystem paths + indexing constants (single source of truth) |
| `model.py` | data: sources manifest, fetch, index, the `Index` store + search |
| `view.py` | rendering: markdown/obsidian/pdf/notebook -> safe HTML, CSP'd pages |
| `controller.py` | HTTP handler + CLI commands wiring model and view together |
| `mcp.py` | the MCP server (search/docs/checklist/tutorial/review tools + prompts) |
| `context.py` | engagement context (targets, hardware, SIM, RF) for the MCP layer |
| `runner.py` | gated execution: env detect, install resolver, command runner |

The package also ships `web/` (the UI) and `sources.default.yaml` (the seed
manifest), so a pip/pipx install is self-contained.

All SQL is funnelled through `model.Index`, where every statement is
parameterized (values are bound, never string-formatted), and free-text queries
pass through `_fts_query` (alphanumeric prefix tokens only) before reaching a
MATCH expression - so a poisoned query can break out of neither the SQL nor the
FTS5 grammar. The test suite includes dedicated SQLi, XSS, SSTI, CSRF, and
path-traversal cases (`python3 -m unittest`).

## How it works

- **fetch** shallow-clones each `sources.yaml` repo into `data/sources/<name>`.
- **index** walks every `*.md` / `*.markdown` / `*.mdx` / `*.rst` / `*.yml` /
  `*.yaml` file (`.rst` so Sphinx-documented projects contribute their *full*
  docs, not just the README) and stores it in a SQLite FTS5 table
  (`data/index.db`) with BM25 ranking. This is the unified layer: all sources,
  one query, regardless of authoring format. A source can pull extra extensions
  with `index_ext:` (e.g. `.ipynb`, `.json`) and, to dump the maximum, sources
  are indexed whole unless a `docs_dir:`/`sparse:` is set to scope a huge repo.
- **serve** is a dependency-free `http.server` exposing the UI plus a small API:
  - `GET /` search UI
  - `GET /api/search?q=&cat=` ranked JSON results (with highlighted snippets)
  - `GET /api/sources` categories for the filter chips
  - `GET /doc?src=&path=` renders a doc (markdown -> HTML) with an origin banner,
    copy buttons and Obsidian link/tag handling
- **build** (optional) runs `mdbook`/`mkdocs` when available for pixel-perfect
  browsing; the index always reads raw markdown so the tool works without it.

## Add your own docs

Both are picked up by `grimoire.py index`:

1. **Drop-in** - put markdown in [`custom/`](custom/) (indexed as source `custom`).
2. **Registered path / Obsidian vault** - add to `sources.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   - name: my-vault
     title: My Vault
     type: local
     path: /home/me/ObsidianVault
     category: custom
   ```

## Embedding in RF-Swift

Grimoire is the `grimoire.py` launcher + the `grimoire_app/` package + manifest
+ web dir, with no required services (stdlib `sqlite3` / `http.server`;
`PyYAML` / `markdown` optional). To bake an
offline knowledge base into an image: run `fetch` + `index` at build time, ship
`data/index.db` (and `data/sources/` for the doc viewer), then `grimoire.py
serve` as a runtime command.

## Security

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the threat model, the controls (parameterized
SQL, CSP/XSS, path-traversal and doc-extension allowlists, tool-name and git-URL
validation, default-off execution), and the residual risks you must understand
before exposing `serve` or enabling MCP `--mode assist|auto`.
