"""Grimoire configuration: filesystem paths and indexing constants.

These module attributes are the single source of truth for paths. Tests and
embedders reassign them (e.g. ``config.DATA = tmp / "data"``) and every other
module reads them as ``config.X`` at call time, so an override is seen
everywhere without re-importing.

Two layouts are supported transparently:
  * in-repo / source checkout - everything lives next to grimoire.py
    (data/, custom/, sources.yaml at the project root).
  * installed (pip / pipx) - the package ships web/ and a default manifest;
    user-writable state (data/, custom/, sources.yaml) goes in a per-user dir
    (GRIMOIRE_HOME, else $XDG_DATA_HOME/grimoire, else ~/.local/share/grimoire).
